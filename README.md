CircleCI Configuration Template
Project Setup for Continuous Integration and Deployment
Overview
This repository contains a reusable CircleCI configuration template for automated testing, building, and releasing projects.
CircleCI Configuration Features
Workflow Steps

Checkout code
Create virtual environment
Install dependencies
Run tests
Build executable
Create GitHub Release

Prerequisites

CircleCI Account
GitHub Repository
Personal Access Token

Configuration Setup
1. GitHub Personal Access Token

Go to GitHub Settings
Developer settings > Personal access tokens
Generate a fine-grained token with:

Repository access
Permissions:

Contents (Read and Write)
Metadata (Read-only)
Releases (Read and Write)



2. CircleCI Environment Variables
In CircleCI project settings, add these environment variables:

GH_TOKEN: GitHub personal access token
Other project-specific variables as needed

Customizing the Configuration
Modify config.yml
Adjust these sections for your project:
yamlCopy# Python version
- image: cimg/python:3.9  # Change to your Python version

# Dependency installation
- run:
    name: Install Dependencies
    command: |
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      pip install pyinstaller  # Add/remove as needed

# Test command
- run:
    name: Run Tests
    command: pytest tests/  # Change to your test runner

# Build command
- run:
    name: Build Executable
    command: pyinstaller --onefile src/your_script.py  # Adjust path
